## ⚖️ Negotiation System

### **Purpose**
To resolve social encounters where persuasion, alliance-building, or conflict of interest drives the story forward. Negotiation mechanics define how characters influence others and how motivations and pitfalls shape their reactions.

### **Core Concepts**
- **Interest Level (0–5):** Tracks how invested the NPC or faction is in the proposal.  
- **Motivations:** The values that the NPC responds positively to.  
- **Pitfalls:** The triggers or themes that provoke negative reactions.  
- **Resolution:** Outcomes depend on final Interest Level and player strategy.

### **Standard Procedure**
1. Identify the NPC or faction and determine their **Motivations** and **Pitfalls**.  
2. Player makes an appeal — narratively or mechanically aligned with a Motivation.  
3. Apply modifiers or rolls as defined by the current rule set.  
4. Adjust Interest Level up or down based on effectiveness and risk.  
5. Resolve using the Outcome Ladder (see below).

### **Outcome Ladder (Interest Levels)**
| Level | Descriptor | Typical Result |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | Hostile | Refusal or counteraction |
| 1 | Distrustful | Minor concession with suspicion |
| 2 | Neutral | Basic acknowledgment, no commitment |
| 3 | Open | Conditional agreement or minor support |
| 4 | Invested | Active cooperation or aid |
| 5 | Committed | Full alignment or long-term alliance |

### **Motivations and Pitfalls List**
> To be completed based on Draw Steel or new Arena of Worlds social framework.

*(Example placeholders — replace or expand as needed.)*  
**Motivations:** Benevolence, Discovery, Freedom, Greed, Higher Authority, Justice, Legacy, Peace, Power, Protection, Revelry, Vengeance  
**Pitfalls:** Any of the same twelve traits used as flaws instead of drives.
