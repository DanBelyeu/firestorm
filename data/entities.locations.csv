loc_rendara_001,rendara,location,Rendara,"A city where illusion and spectacle rule, built upon the layered remains of countless arenas.","Gleaming towers rise above deep subterranean vaults once used for ancient combat games. Illusory light dances through its skyline at night, masking the scars of old tournaments.","Ambitious, performative, restless","Rendara was founded around the first stabilized arena core, expanding outward until its borders fused with the fractured dimensions that birthed it. Many citizens believe the city itself is alive— a sentient echo of past games, hungry for new champions.","metropolis;arena;illusion;urban","TODO:rendara_cityscape.png",TODO,TODO,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
loc_rendara_arena_001,the-arena,location,The Arena,"Rendara’s colossal stadium where ten gateway platforms dispatch teams into pocket-dimension combats before a roaring crowd.","A bowl for hundreds of thousands, ringed by sky-tier galleries and private boxes. At the floor’s edge stand 10 raised platforms, each crowned by a rune-arched Gateway Doorway keyed to a separate combat instance. Above, a shimmering Spectator Veil projects live, multi-angle views from inside the instances onto panoramic air-screens.","Grand, theatrical, precision-tuned—equal parts cathedral and engine room.","Built atop the first stable arena core, The Arena’s gateways synchronize to shard-realms for regulated bouts. Early audiences watched via crystal relay mirrors; today the Veil stitches feeds into seamless, immersive panoramas.","arena;stadium;portals;projection;landmark;urban","TODO:rendara_arena_exterior.png",TODO,"city:loc_rendara_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
loc_rendara_middistrict_001,the-lantern-district,location,The Lantern District,"A bustling middle-class quarter of Rendara filled with taverns, inns, markets, and homes.","Cobblestone streets weave between warm-lit shops, family-run taverns, and modest rowhouses with colorful awnings. Hanging lanterns sway between buildings, casting amber light even in daylight.","Welcoming, industrious, proud of its self-made spirit.","The Lantern District earned its name from the tradition of nightly lantern-lighting ceremonies said to honor the 'flickering hope' of the city’s workers and artisans. Many rising competitors and mages once lived here before fame took them elsewhere.","district;residential;market;tavern;urban","TODO:lantern_district_street.png",TODO,"city:loc_rendara_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
loc_rendara_tavern_001,the-copper-lantern,location,The Copper Lantern,"A warmly lit neighborhood tavern where locals swap stories, check arena odds, and unwind over hearty fare.","Polished wood bar, copper lanterns casting amber light, round tables near a crackling hearth. A discrete odds board updates bout lines; a small side counter handles legal wagers during operating hours.","Welcoming, lively, fair-minded; prides itself on being community-first, not a gamblers’ den.","Founded by retired arena medics who wanted a safe, friendly place for workers and competitors. The owners post responsible-wagering reminders and cut off betting when matches begin.","tavern;inn;betting;community;urban","TODO:copper_lantern_exterior.png",TODO,"city:loc_rendara_001;district:loc_rendara_middistrict_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
loc_rendara_hall_shattered_glass_001,hall-of-shattered-glass,location,Hall of Shattered Glass,"A floating sanctum of fractured realities where the Council of the Veil convenes to shape and govern the arenas.","The Hall appears as a suspended prism above the Arena, its surfaces constantly rearranging into impossible geometries. Each wall reflects a different realm — shards of frozen tundra, scorched desert, or starlit ocean — glimpses of dimensions the Council has mastered. When the mages convene, the fragments align briefly into a perfect mirrored sphere, sealing them within their own reflection.","Awe-inspiring, disorienting, and heavy with the hum of restrained power. To step inside is to feel the world folding around you. The air carries the scent of ozone and the echo of distant voices.","The Hall of Shattered Glass was the first structure successfully built between realities. Created by the joint effort of the seven archmages, it serves as both their council chamber and a nexus for manipulating the Veil. The Hall’s architecture reconfigures in response to the Council’s mood and decisions; it is said that when they argue, entire reflections collapse into dust. Few mortals have seen its interior and returned unmarked by the experience.","location;faction;arena;arcane;council;extradimensional","TODO:hall_shattered_glass.png",TODO,"city:loc_rendara_001;arena:loc_rendara_arena_001;faction:fac_council_veil_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
