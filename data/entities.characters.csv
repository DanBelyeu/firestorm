char_rendara_tavern_owner_001,character,Maris Calden,"Former arena medic turned tavernkeeper; practical, sharp-eyed, and trusted by locals.","Mid-40s human woman with cropped dark hair streaked with silver, wearing rolled sleeves, an apron, and a copper lantern pin. A faint scar runs from temple to jaw.","Warm but no-nonsense, perceptive, remembers faces and favors; quiet authority.","Maris served fifteen years as a field medic in the lower-tier arenas before retiring after a near-fatal gate malfunction.

char_rendara_bookie_001,character,Tarn Volen,"The Copper Lantern’s resident bookmaker — charming, fast-talking, and never far from his ledger.","Wiry human in his 30s with neatly kept hair, ink-stained fingers, and a perpetual half-smile. Wears a short vest lined with pocket charms for luck and a thumb-ring carved from arena stone.","Smooth, calculating, but genuinely enjoys the excitement of the matches. Known for fair odds and quiet discretion.","Tarn was once an assistant oddskeeper for a major Arena syndicate before a scandal sent him into self-imposed exile. Maris gave him a second chance — now he manages wagers for The Copper Lantern, keeping things clean but never dull.","npc;tavern;bookie;betting;ally","TODO:tarn_volen_portrait.png","{""negotiation"":{""motivations"":[""Discovery"",""Greed"",""Protection"",""Legacy""],""pitfalls"":[""Justice"",""Benevolence"",""Power"",""Vengeance""]}}","tavern:loc_rendara_tavern_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
