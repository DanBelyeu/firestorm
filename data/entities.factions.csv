fac_council_veil_001,faction,Council of the Veil,"A conclave of seven archmages who manipulate the veil between worlds to craft, control, and sustain the arenas of Rendara.","The Council meets within the Hall of Shattered Glass, a structure suspended at the nexus above the main Arena — its walls and floor formed from fragments of overlapping realities, constantly shifting between transparency and reflection.","Formal, cerebral, theatrical. Every member sees themselves as both scientist and artist; debate and performance are indistinguishable during their sessions.","The Council of the Veil was founded to stabilize and commercialize pocket-realm warfare after the first uncontrolled rift devastated Rendara’s early districts. Each Archmage governs a branch of the Veil’s discipline — geometry, reflection, binding, transference, firecraft, resonance, and spectacle — ensuring the arenas remain intact and profitable. To the public, they are revered as near-divine figures; to competitors, they are the unseen gods who decide life and death.","faction;arcane;authority;arena;veil;council","TODO:council_of_veil_emblem.png",TODO,"city:loc_rendara_001;arena:loc_rendara_arena_001;location:loc_rendara_hall_shattered_glass_001;member:char_vareth_soluun_001;member:char_mirielle_thane_001;member:char_orun_vexhal_001;member:char_selara_nyn_001;member:char_thalen_corvus_001;member:char_yssa_vale_001;member:char_korran_deyne_001",2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,2025-11-08T00:00:00Z,1.0
